# Factor-Based Portfolio Optimization in Financial Economics

## Project Overview  
This project constructs and evaluates portfolios based on well-known market anomaliesâ€”momentum, value, and size factors. It incorporates volatility and risk analysis to optimize portfolio performance and compare results against the S&P 500 benchmark over time. The goal is to explore the effectiveness of anomaly-driven investment strategies through empirical modeling.

## Repository Contents  
- **R code:** Scripts for data ingestion, model construction, portfolio optimization, and performance tracking versus the S&P 500.  
- **Final Paper:** A comprehensive research paper detailing methodology, analysis, results, and conclusions.  
- **Presentation:** The final presentation summarizing the project scope, findings, and insights.

## Data  
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Bloomberg and cannot be shared publicly due to licensing restrictions. However, you can easily adapt the R code to use your own data by replacing the input files accordingly. 

## Usage  
The R scripts can be run sequentially to replicate the analysis and generate the portfolio performance comparisons. To modify the tracking period, simply adjust the date parameters within the R scripts to your desired timeframe.
